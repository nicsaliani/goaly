# goaly

**goaly** is a minimalistic mobile application designed for creating, customizing, and organizing your goals. Sort goals into Categories, which are containers that can be named, colored, and branded to help make your goals easier to track.

(NOTE: This application is a WIP. Not all features are currently functional or present.)
